FinderRestarter is a plugin for Intellij IDEA that tries to fix Smart Completion on Mac
OS X. 

When you use Intellij IDEA with Google Chrome on Mac OS X, every time you open a
new tab in Chrome, Smart Completion in Intellij IDEA stops working. The only way
to fix this that I know is to restart Finder. This plugin makes it every time
when Idea gains focus.
